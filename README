HBF: Haskell Brainfuck

* Yet another re-invented useless wheel
* No optimization, runs slow
* My first Haskell "application", coding style is poor
* Try to use monad & monad transformers to implement Interpreter State
** IO and pure function is isolated
** Unit tests works on pure functions
* If you are interested in this garbage, yes, it's released with GPLv3, fell free to edit
